## Category: Getting Started

### Q1: What exactly does newlens do?
**Answer:** We help UK businesses automate repetitive work using AI and intelligent workflows. Think of us as your automation partner - we assess your processes, build custom workflows, and manage the technology so you can focus on growing your business. Unlike DIY platforms, we handle everything from strategy to implementation to ongoing support.

**Keywords:** automation, AI, workflows, consulting, managed service

---

### Q2: How is newlens different from Zapier or Make?
**Answer:** Great question! Zapier and Make are DIY platforms - you build automations yourself. newlens is a full-service partner. We provide:
- Expert consulting (we design the automations for you)
- Advanced AI capabilities (not just connecting apps)
- UK-based support and data hosting
- Ongoing optimization and monitoring
- Custom integrations beyond standard app connectors

If you want a managed service with UK data residency, we're your solution. If you want to DIY, those platforms are excellent tools we can also help you use.

**Keywords:** comparison, zapier, make, DIY, managed service, UK

---

### Q3: Do I need technical knowledge to work with newlens?
**Answer:** No! That's the point. We handle all the technical complexity. You just need to:
1. Explain your business processes (you're the expert there)
2. Review and approve what we build
3. Use the automations (simple web interfaces, no coding)

We translate business problems into technical solutions - you don't need to speak code.

**Keywords:** technical, knowledge, skills, non-technical, easy

---

### Q4: How long does it take to get started?
**Answer:**
- **Initial consultation:** 30-60 minutes (book online)
- **AI Readiness Assessment:** 1 week
- **First automation live:** 2-4 weeks (depending on complexity)
- **Full implementation:** 4-12 weeks (typical project)

We can move faster for urgent needs - our record is 3 days from kickoff to first automation running!

**Keywords:** timeline, how long, implementation time, start

---

### Q5: What size businesses do you work with?
**Answer:** We're built for UK SMEs - typically:
- **Team size:** 10-500 employees
- **Industries:** Finance, legal, property, professional services, healthcare
- **Pain point:** Growing fast but drowning in admin/manual work

That said, we've helped solo consultants and also worked with divisions of larger enterprises. If you have repetitive processes eating your team's time, we can probably help.

**Keywords:** business size, SME, enterprise, company size, target market

---

## Category: Pricing & Value

### Q6: How much does newlens cost?
**Answer:** We offer two models:

**Self-Hosted (you own the infrastructure):**
- Initial setup: £14,990 - £29,990
- Monthly subscription: £495 - £4,995 (based on usage)

**newlens-Hosted (we manage everything):**
- Initial setup: £7,990 - £12,990
- Monthly subscription: £795 - £5,995 (all-inclusive)

Most clients start at the Professional tier (£2,995/month hosted) and see ROI within 3 months. We can build a custom proposal after understanding your needs - book a free assessment to get accurate pricing.

**Keywords:** cost, price, pricing, how much, expensive, investment

---

### Q7: Is there a minimum contract length?
**Answer:** Our subscriptions are **month-to-month** after the initial setup. No long-term lock-in. If you're not happy, cancel anytime (though we're confident you'll see value quickly).

Initial setup costs are one-time investments. Some clients choose annual prepay for a 15% discount, but it's optional.

**Keywords:** contract, commitment, minimum term, cancel, lock-in

---

### Q8: What's the ROI? How do I know it's worth it?
**Answer:** Most clients see positive ROI within **3-6 months**. Here's how we calculate it:

**Example: Property Management Firm**
- **Problem:** 2 staff spending 15 hours/week on tenant onboarding (admin, emails, docs)
- **Cost:** 30 hrs/week × £25/hr × 52 weeks = **£39,000/year** in labour
- **Automation saved:** 24 hours/week (80% reduction)
- **Annual savings:** £31,200
- **newlens cost:** £2,995/month = £35,940/year
- **Net ROI:** Break-even in 13 months, then £31k/year profit

Plus: Staff redeployed to revenue-generating work (client relationships, property viewings). True ROI is much higher.

We provide a custom ROI model during your assessment - no guesswork.

**Keywords:** ROI, return on investment, value, worth it, savings, payback

---

### Q9: What if I only need one or two automations?
**Answer:** We can start small! Options:
1. **Project-based:** Pay £2,995 - £7,995 for 1-3 specific automations (no monthly subscription)
2. **Essential tier:** £795/month (up to 5 automations, 5,000 executions)
3. **Consulting only:** We design it, you build it (or your team does) - £150/hour

Many clients start with a pilot automation, prove ROI, then expand. We're happy to grow with you.

**Keywords:** small, one automation, single, pilot, trial, start small

---

### Q10: Are there hidden fees or usage surprises?
**Answer:** **No.** We're transparent:
- Fixed monthly subscription (covers platform, hosting, support)
- Usage limits clearly stated (executions, storage, AI operations)
- If you exceed limits, we contact you **before** charging overage
- Overage rates are reasonable (not exploitative)

The only "extras" are:
- Optional add-on services (more training, custom integrations) - you request these
- Major scope changes during implementation (rare - we scope carefully upfront)

No nasty surprises. Ever.

**Keywords:** hidden fees, surprise costs, overages, transparent pricing

---

## Category: Technical & Implementation

### Q11: What technology does newlens use?
**Answer:** We use best-in-class open-source and enterprise tools:
- **Automation platform:** n8n (flexible, powerful, self-hostable)
- **AI models:** OpenAI (GPT-4), Anthropic (Claude), Google (Gemini), local models where needed
- **Data storage:** PostgreSQL, Supabase (UK-hosted)
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes (for scale)
- **Integrations:** 400+ pre-built connectors + custom APIs

**Why this matters:** You're not locked into proprietary technology. If you ever want to self-manage, you can. Our expertise is in *how* to use these tools effectively, not gatekeeping access.

**Keywords:** technology, tools, platform, n8n, AI models, stack

---

### Q12: Can you integrate with our existing systems?
**Answer:** **Very likely, yes.** We integrate with:
- Standard apps (Xero, HubSpot, Slack, Office 365, Google Workspace, etc.)
- Custom APIs (if your system has an API, we can connect)
- Legacy systems (screen scraping, RPA, file transfers when APIs don't exist)
- Databases (direct SQL connections when needed)

During your assessment, we'll audit your tech stack and confirm compatibility. In 5+ years, we've only encountered 2 systems we couldn't integrate (ancient AS/400 with no API and no file access).

**Keywords:** integration, systems, API, connect, existing software, compatibility

---

### Q13: What if we already use Zapier/Make/Power Automate?
**Answer:** We can:
1. **Audit** what you've built (find gaps, inefficiencies)
2. **Enhance** your existing automations (add AI, improve logic)
3. **Migrate** to a more powerful platform (if you've outgrown DIY)
4. **Manage** your current platform (if you want expert oversight)

Many clients come to us when their DIY automations break or become too complex to maintain. We can help at any stage.

**Keywords:** zapier, make, power automate, existing automations, migrate

---

### Q14: Is our data safe? What about security?
**Answer:** **Absolutely.** Security is core to everything we do:
