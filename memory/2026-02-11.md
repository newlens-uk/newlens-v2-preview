### 🛠️ Surgical Update Protocol (SOP)
To prevent build failures and repository bloat, use this exact process for website iterations:
1.  **Target Repo:** Always use `newlens-v2-preview` for the Vercel staging site (`v2-site-sigma.vercel.app`).
2.  **No Broad Adds:** Never use `git add .`. It risks picking up large assets/backups.
3.  **Surgical Edits:** Only `git add [filename]` (e.g., `git add index.html`).
4.  **Sync Rule:** Copy from `newlens-v2/v2-site/` to `newlens-v2-preview/` before pushing to ensure both repos stay in sync.
5.  **Build Verification:** Ignore "GitHub Pages" failure emails; they are a false positive. Only monitor Vercel for the live update.
