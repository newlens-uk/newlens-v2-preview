## Critical: Website Deployment Protocol Established

**Problem**: Messy deployment today with wrong repo (`newlens-v2` vs `newlens-v2-preview`), overwrites, and confusion.

**Solution**: Created `docs/DEPLOYMENT_PROTOCOL.md` - single source of truth for deployments.

### Key Decisions:

1. **Only ONE repo matters**: `newlens-uk/newlens-v2-preview` (main branch)
2. **Only ONE workspace**: `~/.openclaw/workspace/newlens-v2-preview/`
3. **Never clone again** - always work in existing directory
4. **Always stage specific files** - never `git add .`
5. **Always pull before push** to catch conflicts early

### Workflow:
```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/newlens-v2-preview
git pull origin main
# ... make changes ...
git add specific-file.html
git commit -m "Description"
git push origin main
sleep 40  # Wait for Vercel
# Verify deployment
```

### Vercel CI/CD:
- Auto-deploys on push to `main`
- Takes ~30-45 seconds
- Live at: `https://v2-site-sigma.vercel.app/`

## Final Status - End of Day

### ✅ All Completed
- Homepage navbar scroll spy working smoothly
- Training section bullets fixed (circular SVG)
- Assessment form fully upgraded (Other industry, more tools, no em dashes)
- Alpha Partner form fully upgraded (radio cards, SVG icons)
- Navbar reordered to match page flow
- GitHub Pages spam stopped
- Deployment protocol fully documented

### ⚠️ Blocked - Needs Manual Action Tomorrow
1. **n8n workflows** - Need HubSpot credentials added in n8n UI (only you can do this)
2. **Portal deployment** - Need Vercel project setup (requires your Vercel account)

### 📝 Ready for Tomorrow
- All forms are wired and ready to activate
- Portal code is ready to deploy
- Documentation is complete
- No technical blockers

## Today's Work

### Homepage (`index.html`)
- Fixed navbar scroll spy with explicit section order (including `how-we-work`)
- Changed training section bullets from arrows (→) to circular SVG bullets
- Proper alignment with `mt-[6px]` and `gap-3`

### Assessment Form (`assessment-new.html`)
- Added "Other" industry option with text input field
- Fixed scroll to top (0 instead of 200px)
- Added 4 more tool options (Email, Slack/Teams, Booking, ERP)
- Removed "No sales fluff" from commitment text
- Changed em dash to period

### Alpha Partner Form (`alpha-partner.html`)
- Replaced emoji icons with proper SVG icons (money, lightning, chart, sparkle)
- Converted all dropdowns to visual radio card grids
- Added hover/selection states with teal borders
- Removed all em dashes, replaced with " - " format
- Fixed validation to handle radio buttons properly

### Typography Rules
- **No em dashes** (—) ever - use " - " instead
- **No "sales fluff" language** - keep it practical
- Use UK English (optimise, programmes)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Multiple repos = confusion** - stick to one source of truth
2. **Document deployment workflow** - don't rely on memory
3. **Surgical updates** - always stage specific files
4. **Verify before declaring done** - check live site after push

**Next Session**: Before ANY deployment work, read `docs/DEPLOYMENT_PROTOCOL.md` first.
