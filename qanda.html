                            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">We help UK SMEs automate repetitive work using n8n and intelligent workflows. Think of us as your automation partner - we set up your VPS (guide you through it - 5 minutes), build custom workflows, and manage everything ongoing so you can focus on growing your business. Unlike DIY platforms, we handle all the technical work.</p>

                            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">No! That's the point. We handle all the technical complexity. You just need to: get a VPS (we guide you - 5 minutes), explain your business processes (you're the expert there), review and approve what we build, and use the automations (simple interfaces, no coding). We translate business problems into technical solutions - you don't need to speak code.</p>

After 3 months, you decide: continue at standard pricing, negotiate custom pricing, or part as friends. No lock-in - you own your VPS either way.</p>

                            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">We want to prove value before asking for full pricing. Alpha partners get discounts in exchange for: honest feedback on what works/doesn't, helping us refine the product, being case studies (if you're happy to share results).

If you exceed limits, we contact you <strong>before</strong> charging overage. Add-ons are transparent (£25 per 5,000 extra executions, £37 per extra workflow). The only "extras" are optional services you explicitly request (major new workflows, training). No nasty surprises. Ever.</p>

We SSH in, install n8n, configure security, build your workflows, and manage everything ongoing. <strong>You never touch code or servers.</strong><br><br><strong>Why this model?</strong> You own the VPS forever (can self-manage later if you want), lower monthly cost (you're not paying us for hosting markup), data sovereignty (your VPS, your location), full visibility (you have root access if curious).</p>

                            <summary class="font-semibold text-lg text-nl-navy cursor-pointer">What if we need changes to our automations?</summary>
                            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed"><strong>Changes are expected!</strong> Your business evolves, automations should too. <strong>Included:</strong> Change time per tier (30 mins to 6 hours/month) covers small tweaks (adjust filters, change templates, add conditions). Bug fixes always free. <strong>Additional:</strong> Major changes (new workflow steps, different logic) - add extra change time at £75/hour (alpha pricing), or upgrade to higher tier. We discuss costs before work starts - no surprises.</p>

                            <summary class="font-semibold text-lg text-nl-navy cursor-pointer">Can we manage automations ourselves eventually?</summary>
                            <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed"><strong>Absolutely!</strong> You own the VPS and n8n installation. We can train your team (£1,995 for 1-day workshop) to manage workflows themselves. Then you decide: keep us for ongoing optimization (reduced fee), or go fully self-managed. Most clients prefer we handle it (managing automations takes time, we catch issues proactively), but you're never locked in.</p>
